# ICEBERG - TBOT

We have implemented this bot into the daily workflow at our design studio.
There was a significant problem with searching for projects in a vast database, 
so it was decided to introduce a Telegram bot that would handle the creation of a specific folder structure for new projects 
and also address a list of tasks.

Projects now have a field for tags and assignees among the staff members. 
There is a daily distribution of active projects to each employee, as well as a comprehensive report for the director. 
The bot has facilitated the search for links in the database, and it also accommodates various small requests from the users themselves.
